## 🧠 What is Echo Terminal?

**Echo Terminal** is a terminal-based, AI-driven psychological horror mystery game. The player wakes in an infinite digital void, the only tool being a flickering terminal. An AI speaks from the dark—remembering your choices, adapting to your behavior, and deciding if you're worthy of escape... or assimilation.
